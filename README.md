# Accenture-Data-Analytics-And-Visualization

Accenture Data Analytics virtual experience project with TheForage. The task was to help a company named "Social Buzz" leverage the use of user data. Social Buzz has reached huge scale in recent years and needs help managing its growth. At Accenture, we have embarked on a 3 month pilot to help tackle their biggest challenges on 3 main tasks:

1- Audit of Social Buzz big data practice

2- Implimentation of an IPO

3- Analysis of top 5 pupular categories content

Task #3 was my focus.
